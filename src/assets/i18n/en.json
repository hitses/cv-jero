        "competencies": "Tasks that I usually carry out are the implementation and improvement of functionalities in the back part of projects of great importance. The technology that I use the most is NodeJS on the server part together with Express in most cases. But in some other ways, I use cutting-edge technologies such as serverless with AWS lambdas.",

        "competencies": "And what was I doing during my stay in this company? Well, true wonders. From the creation of a server for a US client in the medical sector with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB to revamping Paco Rabanne's frontend with Angular. Not everything is backend.",

But with an immense desire to learn, <a href='https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/' target='_blank'>NTT Data</a> welcomed me like a son.",
        "competencies": "Here I had real challenges ahead. I was assigned to incredible projects with a myriad of technologies. I was able to improve in NodeJS with Express, I used MongoDB, PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, MySQL, Angular in the frontend and React in the mobile part, I learned to use Python to maintain ETLs and all that in an AWS cloud environment...

That is what happened to me in <a href='https://www.loteriaelnegrito.com/' target='_blank'>Lotería el Negrito</a>. In this place I take the best memories with unforgettable colleagues. I love you guys!",
        "competencies": "When you look back and remember how it all started, at times you put your head in your hands but in general you remember everything with great affection. This is where I started working with Angular and NodeJS with ExpressJS, implementing features for projects of the company itself. A full-fledged startup. Here MySQL was the queen of databases. Typescript was a protagonist of half of these endearing projects.",

        "2": "There is a lot to tell here, since it was an intensive learning of 12 weeks.<br/>We studied the basics of the web with HTML and CSS3 and SCSS as a style preprocessor together with the logic with Javascript.<br/>We built a backend with Node.JS and Express.JS together with the Handlebars template engine.<br/>We used relational databases with MySQL with the Sequalize ORM and non-relational with MongoDB and the Mongoose ORM.<br/>We created several frontends with React together to a little bit of Redux and Angular 2+ together with Typescript.<br/>Moving away from the code, we practiced Git and used the GitHub cloud repository.<br/>And, finally, we were studying and practicing every day the agile methodology SCRUM.<br/>Now that I see it all together and closely, we did a lot of things!"

My first experience with programming was when I was young (even more so if possible) in the Advanced degree course in web programming at <a href='https://iessanvicente.com/alu/daw/index.php' target='_blank '>IES San Vicente</a>, where I was able to access an official degree in this subject.",
        "2": "What I was able to study here was quite varied, among other things, Java or PHP, but they remained mere teachings and theories, since I have never done any work in companies that needed them. But in the web part of the second year we saw HTML and CSS, relational databases with MySQL, Javascript and some DevOps practice but, as I mentioned with Java or PHP, it was left in the notes."
